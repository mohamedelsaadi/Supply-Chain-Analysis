Supply Chain Analysis Dashboard! 



Iâ€™ve just completed a Supply Chain Analysis dashboard using Power BI, where I focused on providing valuable insights for optimizing supply chain performance.

 This project involved comprehensive data cleaning using Power Query and the creation of a star schema consisting of one Fact Sales table and five Dimension tables to ensure efficient data modeling.



*  Project Highlights:

- Total Sales: $37M

- Total Profit: $3.97M

- Total Orders: 181K

- Discounted Orders: 170K



 * Visual Insights:

Sales by Product Category 

Regional Sales Distribution 

Shipping and Delivery Trends 

Profitability Analysis per Customer 



With this dashboard, businesses can now gain deeper insights into sales performance, delivery efficiency, and profit optimization, making data-driven decisions to enhance overall supply chain operations.
